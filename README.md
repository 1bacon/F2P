# F2P
## Peer2Peer File Transfer

Creates a direct connection between two Hosts, to directly share files.
Only needs a third Server for connecting.


TODO:
- UDP Hole Punching
- Packet verification (checksum probably)
- Interactive cli (cmd2)

Plans:
- direct and indirct mode (In a direct Session vs being "online", someone can offer a file with a notification)
- Windows Context menu?
- Background service (Autostart?)


Maybe someday:
- GUI
- Pools (n x m instead of 1 x 1)
